## ABSTRACT
This project uses an ultrasonic senor(Hd44780) to measure distance with ATmega 328 microcontroller. An ultrasonic sensor is an instrument that measures the distance to an object using ultrasonic sound waves . The sensor works in such a way that the sensor sends an ultrasonic pulse if any object is being sensed the pulse bounces back to the sensor.
This method of Span measurement is efficient way to measure small distances precisely.
